This is [wercker](http://wercker.com/) build step script to package your directories as `.zip`. 

## Usage

In the `wercker.yml` of your application use the following step definition:

```yaml
steps:
   - tcnksm/zip:
     input: $WERCKER_OUTPUT_DIR/pkg
     output: $WERCKER_OUTPUT_DIR/dist
```

You must set `input` directory where directories you want to package are in and `output` directory where zip archeives will be generated. Both must be set as absolte path (`$WERCKER_OUTPUT_PATH` is built-in environmental valiable which is used for pass the artifacts between build step and deploy step).
